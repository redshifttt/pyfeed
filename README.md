# pyfeed

pyfeed is a simple modal command-based CLI RSS feed reader for Linux.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or whatever is equivalent on your distribution.

## Why?

I didn't like newsboat and I was into Python at the time of writing this. I
also needed something simple to be able to just read news.
